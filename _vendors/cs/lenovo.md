explanation: "We're still gathering more info on battery saving features on Lenovo devices."
user_solution: "### Lenovo P2\nLenovo P2 has a very good battery life, but at a cost.\nFor an app to work in the background:\n* Enable the **padlock icon** at an app in the right top corner in the overview of running apps. It's only then actually running as a foreground process. If you swipe it away, its background process will be killed mercilessly.\nIt does not matter if the battery/power optimization is \"On\" or \"Off\" in **Settings -> Apps -> Your app -> Battery**."
developer_solution: "At the moment we don't know of any solution on the dev end."
