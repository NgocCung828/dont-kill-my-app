user_solution: "## Oppo F1S\nBackground services are being killed (including accessibility services, which then need re-enabling) every time you turn the screen off. So far, a workaround for this is:\n* Pin your app to the recent apps screen.\n* Enable your app in the app list inside the security app's \"startup manager\" and \"floating app list\" (com.coloros.safecenter / com.coloros.safecenter.permission.Permission).\n* Turn off battery optimizations.\n* Give the service a persistent notification to remain in the foreground.\nAll four of those need to be done before the app would function.\n<div class=\"img-block\">\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"/assets/img/oppo/oppo_autolaunch1.jpg\">\n    <figcaption>Open App management.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"/assets/img/oppo/oppo_autolaunch2.jpg\">\n    <figcaption>Toggle to allow Your app.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"img-block\">\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"/assets/img/oppo/oppo_background1.jpg\">\n    <figcaption>App info -> Battery usage</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"/assets/img/oppo/oppo_background2.jpg\">\n    <figcaption>Choose Run in background.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n</div>\nHere are links to some other resources verifying that some of the above steps work on other Oppo devices:\n* [XDA developers](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/general/coloros-5-0-how-to-allow-apps-running-t3847738)\n* [XDA developers](https://forum.xda-developers.com/find-X/help/killing-apps-screen-off-arghh-t3818105)\n* [Oppo customer service portal](https://oppo-au.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1313/~/how-to-lock-applications-in-the-background%3F)\n* [Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-add-apps-into-Whitelist-in-OPPO-F1s-phone)"
